<text>Spain is on course to become the first EU country with a natural world heritage site placed on Unesco&#x27;s danger list, according to a report.

The Doñana wetlands in Andalucía is a critical watering stop for millions of migratory birds, but the area has lost 80 per cent of its marshland over the past century due to industrial activity. The United Nations cultural agency has given Spain until Dec 1 to present a report on Doñana&#x27;s conservation, or the site could be added to a list of sites in danger.
