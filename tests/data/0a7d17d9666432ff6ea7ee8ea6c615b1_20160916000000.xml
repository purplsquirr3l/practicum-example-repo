<text>MORE than half the BBC stars paid more than £150,000 may escape having their salaries made public, after a loophole emerged in new plans to force the corporation to be more transparent.



Karen Bradley, the Culture Secretary, yesterday unveiled proposals to compel the BBC to publish the salaries of the 109 presenters and performers who are paid more than £150,000 a year in its next annual report.

But it emerged last night that the transparency edict would not extend to stars working for the corporation&#x27;s new production division, BBC Studios, which is expected to get approval to launch later this year. All television shows that are made by the BBC&#x27;s inhouse teams, except for sports, news and children&#x27;s programmes, will transfer to the new commercial subsidiary when it is spun off, with the result that presenters such as Tess Daly, Claudia Winkleman and Brian Cox will fall outside the transparency rules.

Senior MPs last night called on ministers to redraft clauses within the corporation&#x27;s new royal charter, to ensure that stars employed by the new division did not escape having their salaries published.

Damian Collins, acting chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, said: &quot;If there&#x27;s widespread abuse or an attempt to hide talent pay, we would have to look at extending it to commercial subsidiaries too.&quot;

John Whittingdale, the former culture secretary, added: &quot;They should make it a condition of the contracts that if it&#x27;s going to be over £150,000, it should be made public. It&#x27;s clear what the Government wants to achieve and I would hope that the BBC acts within the spirit - not just the letter - of the rules.&quot;

After being alerted to the loophole, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport last night pledged to tighten up the plans. A spokesman said: &quot;Ministers have been clear that all BBC staff and talent currently earning more than £150,000 should be named in this year&#x27;s annual report and that further discussions will take place on the arrangements for future years. Those discussions will include arrangements for BBC Studios, if and when it comes into being.&quot;

But the BBC said it would not agree to publish the names, insisting that doing so would prevent its new subsidiary from competing on a level playing field with commercial rivals.

Around 30 of the 109 stars on salaries of more than £150,000 are said to work in BBC News, with a small number working in children&#x27;s, sport, and radio production, who will not transfer to BBC Studios. The current plans also do not include those paid via independent production companies, including actors such as Poldark star Aidan Turner.
